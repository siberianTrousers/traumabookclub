    Purpose
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        The purpose of the safety protocol is to ensure that individuals involved in the Book Club do not expose themselves to unnecessary dangers or risks. Primarily, we are concerned about individuals being doxxed or harassed, and individuals being solicited by potential predators hiding among us.

        <b>Have reasonable suspicions about everyone you do not know - including the moderators and any of the TraumaBookClub team.</b> While we endeavour to place responsible, trustworthy individuals in these positions, we are unable to fully vet and and supervise everyone involved. This naturally extends to all the members and participants of the Book Club.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        Do not reveal your full name or give out any identifying information, such as your address or phone number. You can tell us what city or state you are from, if you’d like.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        Do not share your contact information if it has identifying information. For instance, if your phone number is publicly listed or associated online with your name/address, do not give it out. If your email has your name or city in it, do not share it.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        <b>Do not agree to meet with people from the Book Club in real life. </b>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        While we encourage you to become friendly with your peers, <b>we strongly discourage romantic/sexual relationships among our participants.</b> We fundamentally cannot guarantee your safety, and moreover <b>we cannot guarantee there are no predators or potential abusers among us.</b> The optimal strategy is to err on the side of caution. Avoid getting seriously involved with other participants.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        If you post regularly on reddit, <b>use a separate reddit account</b> to post about your more personal/traumatic experiences. <b>If possible, obscure personal details by changing out dates, locations, identifiers, etc.</b>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        Be suspicious of anyone offering cures, solutions, mailing lists, get-rich schemes, etc. If you experience or witness any such behaviour, <b>immediately report them to a moderator or to the TraumaBookClub team (<a href="mailto:cptsdBookClub@gmail.com?subject=[URGENT]">cptsdBookClub@gmail.com</a>) with the subject “[URGENT]”.</b>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        We want to develop helpful and accessible guides for people to more easily identify potential predators or abusive behaviours. If you are interested in collaborating on something of the sort, please reach out to us via the email address listed above.
