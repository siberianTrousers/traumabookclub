    What is the Trauma Book Club?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        The Trauma Book Club (TBC) is a volunteer, peer-organized online community of trauma survivors providing free and accessible resources for recovery.

    What do you guys do?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        We run an ongoing book club to help a community of trauma survivors get through emotionally-difficult texts about recovery.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        The TBC is also running a by-donation book drive to get copies of Pete Walker’s Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving into the hands of people who need it.

    Why are you doing this?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        The TBC team is composed entirely of trauma survivors and trauma advocates. We collectively identified a lack of effective, accessible online resources for trauma survivors and sought to build our own.

  <br>
  <li class="firstTierDetail">
    What makes you qualified to do this?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        We really aren’t. The only experience we can claim to have is our own varied professional backgrounds, and our personal journeys as trauma survivors. We are not trying to be therapists, we are simply trying to provide validation and peer support to trauma survivors who are often isolated and marginalized by society and existing healthcare institutions.

  <li class="firstTierDetail">
    How do we know we can trust you?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        To put it bluntly, you cannot. At the end of the day, the best practice is always to maintain reasonable suspicions about all online entities that target vulnerable people - especially when they are soliciting money, as TBC is for our Book Drive.
        <br>
        However, we have endeavoured to make our processes and mechanisms as transparent as possible. You can audit our financial ledger for the book drive. You will have access to our protocols and structures for all our online zoom sessions. And if you examine our practices, you will see we endeavour to minimize all risks as it pertains to privacy, anonymity, and the unavoidable danger of predators hiding within our community.

    Who are you?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">
        The TBC Team is made up of a variety of volunteers from all across the world. We all identify as trauma survivors one way or another, and we all identify with the mission and need to advocate on behalf of trauma survivors and their needs.
