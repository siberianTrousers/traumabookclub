<ol class="single-page-list first-tier-list">

<hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">Definition Of Complex PTSD</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">CPTSD is environmentally caused, not genetically. It is a learned set of
    maladaptive responses and a failure to complete numerous developmental tasks.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">This means that the behaviours/symptoms/maladaptations can be “unlearned”.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">The book is oriented towards "the most prevalent kind of CPTSD".
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Thus focuses on healing damage from abuse and abandonment that is rooted mostly in childhood trauma and abuse/neglect</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Recovery has crucial self-help and relational components. The relational component involving other trusted and safe persons, Walker refers to as “Reparenting by committee”
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail"><b>The self help component, in contrast, doesn't have to involve other people.</b></li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Any combination of verbal/physical/emotional/sexual abuse, when severe enough, can cause development of CPTSD</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">PTSD vs CPTSD: CPTSD is a much more severe form of PTSD that tends to have 5 core components:
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Emotional flashbacks - these may range in severity and duration, but an extreme and prolonged episode is defined as a “regression”</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Toxic shame, abandonment melange and abandonment depression.</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Self abandonment</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Inner critic</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Social anxiety &#8594 Social phobia</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">What is an emotional flashback?</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions ('amygdala hijackings') to frightening circumstances of childhood.
    They are typically experienced as intense and confusing episodes of fear and/or despair - or as sorrowful and/or enraged reactions to this fear and despair.
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Inner critic adds a layer of toxic shame;
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Inhibits the individual from seeking comfort and support, isolating him in an overwhelming and humiliating sense of defectiveness.</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Hyperarousal of the sympathetic nervous system, the half of the nervous system that controls arousal and activation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">What is toxic shame?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Unlike healthy shame, toxic shame is the false sense that we are failures or defective. </li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">If this premise is believed, it is likely we create a false-self that is no longer our authentic selves.
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierList">It also prevents us from ever seeking help or support, as we reenact childhood abandonment.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Think about the fawning self that compromises all their own personal boundaries, or allowing ourselves to be constantly drained by emotional vampires.</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">“The abandonment mélange is the fear and toxic shame that surrounds and interacts with the abandonment depression. The abandonment depression itself is the deadened feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that afflicts traumatized children.”</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">If you are stuck viewing yourself as worthless, defective, or despicable, you are probably in an emotional flashback.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">List of Common CPTSD symptoms:</h4>

  <p>Survivors may not experience all of these. Varying combinations are common. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Emotional Flashbacks</li>
    <li>Tyrannical Inner and/or Outer Critic</li>
    <li>Toxic Shame</li>
    <li>Self-Abandonment</li>
    <li>Social anxiety</li>
    <li>Abject feelings of loneliness and abandonment</li>
    <li>Fragile Self-esteem</li>
    <li>Attachment disorder</li>
    <li>Developmental Arrests</li>
    <li>Relationship difficulties</li>
    <li>Radical mood vacillations [e.g., pseudo-cyclothymia: see chapter 12]</li>
    <li>Dissociation via distracting activities or mental processes</li>
    <li>Hair-triggered fight/flight response</li>
    <li>Oversensitivity to stressful situations</li>
    <li>Suicidal Ideation</li>
  </ul>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">Suicidal Ideation</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Suicidality - depressed thinking or fantasizing about wanting to die. Common phenomenon in CPTSD survivors,particularly during intense or prolonged flashbacks.</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Differentiating between active versus passive suicidality
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Passive - Ranges from wishing you were dead to fantasizing about ways to end your life. Maybe you fantasize - or even obsess - about being hit by a bus while crossing the street. More common with CPTSD survivors.</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Active - directly making plans to take one’s life.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Competent therapists and caregivers can distinguish between the two, and in treating passive suicidality will invite you to open up emotionally and verbally ventilate.</li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">What You May Have Been Misdiagnosed With</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">“I once heard renowned traumatologist, John Briere, quip that if CPTSD were ever given its due, the DSM [The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] used by all mental health professionals would shrink from its dictionary like size to the size of a thin pamphlet.”
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">In other words, the role of traumatized childhoods in most adult psychological disorders is enormous.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail"><b>In his own clinical experience</b>, Walker has encountered a lot of CPTSD patients that are “misdiagnosed with various anxiety and depressive disorders. Moreover, many are also unfairly and inaccurately labeled with bipolar, narcissistic, codependent, autistic spectrum, and borderline disorders.”</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">In addition, he mentions that ADHD/OCD are sometimes more accurately described as “fixated flight responses to trauma”.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">In addition, he mentions that ADHD/OCD are sometimes more accurately described as “fixated flight responses to trauma”.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Walker’s emphasis: <b>The key point is that these labels are incomplete and unnecessarily shaming descriptions of what the survivor is actually afflicted with.</b></li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Behaviors classified as pathological that aid in the above diagnoses are unfairly treated as “innate characterological defects” instead of as “learned maladaptations to stress [and trauma]”.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Subsequently, even process and substance addictions can be viewed in this lens</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">Origins Of CPTSD</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">“While the origin of Cptsd is most often associated with extended periods of physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood, my observations convince me that ongoing verbal and emotional abuse also causes it.”</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">What is contempt? A “toxic cocktail of verbal and emotional abuse”. Some combo of rage, disgust, that creates fear and shame in the child and discourages them from ever seeking help or emoting. Physical abuse == corporal punishment, as we observe in slaveholders and prison guards.</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail"><b>Emotional neglect alone can cause CPTSD.</b>
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">“This key theme is explored at length in chapter 5. If you notice that you are berating yourself because your trauma seems insignificant compared to others, please skip ahead to this chapter and resume reading here upon completion.”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Emotionally neglect is also a core component of most traumatizations that are more easily manifested. The natural consequence of a parent routinely ignoring a child’s call for attention/connection/help, and generally abandoning a child to “unmanageable amounts of fear” forces the child to eventually give up and succumb to helplessness and hopelessness.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">This can very easily lead to early suicidal ideation. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">More About Trauma</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">What is trauma?
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Trauma is any disturbing experience and the resulting constellation of emotional and physiological challenges that result. </li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Walker: Trauma is more specifically, the result of triggering a fight/flight response so intensely that a person cannot deactivate that response when the threat is removed. The survivor becomes “stuck in an adrenalized state”, where the sympathetic nervous system is consistently activated and the relaxation function of the parasympathetic nervous system is suspended.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Trauma does not have to result in a trauma disorder.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Walker presents the case of a child dealing with a school bully, wherein the survivor’s parents are able to properly soothe and protect the child.</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">As a consequence, the child will be “released from the trauma…[and] naturally relax back into the safety of the parasympathetic nervous system’s functioning.”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">However, if the trauma is repetitive and ongoing - <b>and no help is available</b> - the child will become frozen in the trauma such that symptoms of a trauma disorder will emerge.</li>
  <li class="firstTierDetail">Additionally, trauma survivors will experience new traumas as particularly severe emotional flashbacks, as opposed to what a non-trauma survivor would experience.</li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">The Four F’s: Fight, Flight, Freeze And Fawn</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Fight or Flight system, but expanded to include Fawn and Freeze.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Fight: responding aggressively to something threatening</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Flight: fleeing a perceived threat, or launching into hyperactivity</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Freeze: realizing resistance is futile, gives up, numbs out into dissociation, and/or collapses as if accepting the inevitability of being hurt</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Fawn: Trying to be pleasing or helpful in order to appease and forestall an attacker.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">birth order and typical narcissistic or abusive parental behaviours can influence the sort of 4F response in the victims.</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Traumatized children often "over-gravitate" to one of these four response patterns to survive, and then eventually they become entrenched into defensive structures that are similar to:
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">narcissistic - fight</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">obsessive/compulsive - flight</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">dissociative - freeze</li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">or codependent structures - fawn</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">What is scapegoating - process by which a bully offloads and externalizes his pain and stress and frustration by attacking a less powerful person.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Brings the bully momentary relief, but does not effectively metabolize or release his pain, and scapegoating soon resumes as the internal discomfort resurfaces.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">In cases more dysfunctional, scapegoating can be a collective form of abuse many members of a family engage in.</li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">The 4F’s In A Cptsd-Inducing Family</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Birth order: Bob &#8594 Carol &#8594 Maude</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Carol’s anxiety from her home life turned into an obsessive/compulsive approach to her school work, eventually maturing into a life-spoiling perfectionism and workaholism.</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Carol’s older brother Bob, who appears to be the golden child, also becomes ensnared in scapegoating Carol, becoming one of her abusers in his own right.</li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Carol remained symbolically enthralled to the family by getting ensnared with narcissistic people who were just as abusive and neglectful as her parents. This well known psychological phenomenon is called "repetition compulsion" or reenactment, and trauma survivors are extremely susceptible to it. </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Carol's younger sister, Maude, was the classic lost child.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">Parents became exhausted by previous kids so they left the child to raise themselves.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Maude used food to self-soothe, and maladaptive daydreaming. </li>

  <hr><h4 class="firstTierTitle">Poor Parenting Creates Pathological Sibling Rivalry</h4>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">Parents may consciously or unconsciously practice the “divide and conquer” mentality among their children, promoting pathological sibling dynamics. </li>
  <li class="firstTierDetail">In addition, all children subsist on minimal nurturance, creating a hypercompetitive environment. Additionally, they are unable to support each other emotionally or otherwise.</li>
  <li class="firstTierDetail">Emotional incest, narcissistic parent setting up a kid for failure by priming him for domestic service once their partner dies</li>
  <li class="firstTierDetail">Scapegoat title may be bestowed on anyone of the 4F types depending on the given family. is also not static, may shift from one person to another or differ from abuser to abuser.</li>
</ol>
