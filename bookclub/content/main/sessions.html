                Crosstalk is interrupting, giving advice, or making comments about another person’s sharing. It is also talking to someone or making distracting noise during sharing time. In TBC, we don’t crosstalk. When others share with us, just listen; our reality, our truth, our ideas, our feelings, our self-image, our beings are affirmed. When we focus only on our own recovery (keeping out of other people’s), we are taking responsibility for our own lives. We do this by presenting all statements in the “I”, first-person, form.

              If somebody does it, mute them and say “just as a reminder, we do not allow any cross talk in our sessions. Please refrain from interrupting, giving advice, or making comments about another person’s sharing”.

              Text that person, make sure they understand what rule they have violated and that if they continue they will be asked to leave. Further violations will result in a temporary, and then a permanent ban.

              Mute them for the rest of the session, but allow them to speak at the end or in the afterparty session.
