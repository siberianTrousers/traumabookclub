<h1 class="singlePageHeader" role="heading">Peer Session Protocols</h1>
<ol class="single-page-list first-tier-list">
  <li class="firstTierDetail">We do not engage in cross-talk
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">What is cross talk
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Crosstalk is interrupting, giving advice, or making comments about another person’s sharing. It is also talking to someone or making distracting noise during sharing time. In TBC, we don’t crosstalk. When others share with us, just listen; our reality, our truth, our ideas, our feelings, our self-image, our beings are affirmed. When we focus only on our own recovery (keeping out of other people’s), we are taking responsibility for our own lives. We do this by presenting all statements in the “I”, first-person, form.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">How to enforce
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">If somebody does it, mute them and say “just as a reminder, we do not allow any cross talk in our sessions. Please refrain from interrupting, giving advice, or making comments about another person’s sharing”.</li>
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Text that person, make sure they understand what rule they have violated and that if they continue they will be asked to leave. Further violations will result in a temporary, and then a permanent ban. </li>
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Mute them for the rest of the session, but allow them to speak at the end or in the afterparty session.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="secondTierDetail">How to avoid
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Only let one person speak at a time - control this via muting, etc.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">We do not reference the content of other people’s shares, but we can reference the emotions.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">What
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">If someone says “i was neglected by my caretaker in that they didn’t feed me, and that made me feel insecure and abandoned”, someone else cannot say “just like that person was saying earlier about not being fed…”</li>
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">They CAN however say “i can relate to the feeling of being insecure and abandoned, because I experienced that when….”</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li class="secondTierDetail">Why
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">The crosstalk rule is very good, but sometimes it may be important to demonstrate to trauma survivors that other survivors have experienced similar feelings of abandonment, depression, neglect, being unwanted, etc. This rule is not set in stone and is subject to change depending on what we see with the results.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">We do not give advice
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">What constitutes “advice”
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Anything along the lines of “you should try x as a treatment for y”. As an extension of the crosstalk rule, someone wouldn’t be able to say “i also had an eating disorder, and what worked for me was getting a vyvanse prescription from my GP because” that is both cross talk and giving advice.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li class="secondTierDetail">How to differentiate from saying “Something worked for me”
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Someone is allowed to say “i had x experience, and what helped me was y”. They are not allowed to elaborate further on it, unless it is pertinent to their share. For instance, if someone used hallucinogenic substances to treat a depressive episode, they cannot then say “I got my shrooms from this guy Kyle on the Dark web, who’s available at this email address”. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li class="secondTierDetail">How to avoid
        <ol class="third-tier-list">
          <li class="thirdTierDetail">Remind everyone of this rule at the beginning of every session (along with every other rule). If someone starts talking about that kind of thing, gently cut in and remind them to be careful to avoid giving advice (if you think it is necessary, this is up to moderator discretion).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li class="firstTierDetail">We do not repeat what is said in the meetings (in any context). We also do not record the meetings in text/audio/video or any other format.
    <ol class="second-tier-list">
      <li class="secondTierDetail">“Who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, let it stay here,” is a good rule to follow in creating a safe place to share our feelings and recovery without fear of gossip, retaliation, or of our anonymity being broken.</li>
  </li>

</ol>
